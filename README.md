# bookInventory-webApp
 1) JSON as database 2) MongoDB as database 

 1-- In the 'bookInventory-json-webApp' I've decided to use JSON as my form of database. The inventory gets saved in a json file.

 2-- In the 'bookInventory-mongoDB-webApp' I've decided to use MongoDB as my form of database. Inventory directly gets saved the MongoDB database.
